# ball-game
A little 2D physics game with balls that you can throw around.
# What's the deal with this dumb game?
I made it public so people can copy and paste this physics code into their projects to save them some time hopefully.
# Will It be updated?
Probably not.
# Rules
Put in a commit, and I'll probably look at it.
You can modify the game in any way you want.
